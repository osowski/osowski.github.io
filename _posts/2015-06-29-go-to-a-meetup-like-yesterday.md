The concept of a Meetup isn&#8217;t anything new.  It&#8217;s been around tech circles for a while in the form of a User Group.  But the term _User Group _suggested some amount of time invested into the technology or a certain level of expertise.  If I am completely new, what business do I have going to a _User Group_ where people are actually&#8230; users!

Here are a couple things I&#8217;ve learned since I&#8217;ve started attending Meetups across the country, as I travel for work.

## Go to Meetups to learn

Meetups have become much like the campfires of the Wild West.  Everyone comes to tell their stories and listen to everyone else&#8217;s stories.  You don&#8217;t need to be an expert to attend a Meetup.  Just have an interest and be willing to learn.

You like beer?  There&#8217;s a meetup for that.

You like food?  There&#8217;s a meetup for that.

You like to code?  There&#8217;s a meetup for that.

(_Hint:_  There&#8217;s generally going to be meetups that let you do all three at once)

_There isn&#8217;t going to be a better experience for &#8220;learn by doing&#8221; than a Meetup for most technology today._

## Attendance does not mean participation

Most of the Meetups I have attended over the past 18 months have had a pretty good distribution of &#8220;newbies&#8221; to &#8220;experienced users&#8221;.  It doesn&#8217;t hurt to start your meetup with some level setting information:

  * Sign up URLs
  * Getting started links
  * One-pager of terms
  * Recap of last meetup

As humans, we&#8217;re more likely to admit we didn&#8217;t know something after you tell us rather than speaking up before hand.

_Just because someone is attending your Meetup, that does not mean they have registered for your service or product, let alone used it in any way_.

## The Death of Release Notes

As software is becoming more continuously delivered and more continuously released, it makes it more difficult to disseminate change information.  In the 5 years my product heavily depended on WebSphere Application Server, I can count the number of Release Notes documents I read on one finger.

_As product updates are released, they should be accompanied with blogs and videos from the product teams.  _

_If you run Meetups, plan your weekly or regularly scheduled topics around your product releases to cover the updates._

Nothing is worse than exposing new users to mass confusion when experienced users don&#8217;t agree with breaking changes.

### Going forward

Meetups are a great change to engaging a community previously left to Message Boards and Bug Trackers.  As new technologies pop up and persist, their associated Meetups will grow across the world as well.  It&#8217;s the rebirth of face to face communication, alongside not instead of technology.

Feel free to let me know of Meetups you&#8217;ve attended or plan to or would like to see.  I&#8217;ll be posting in the _Meetups _category as I attend more throughout the coming months.
